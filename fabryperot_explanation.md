## Explanation of FabryPerot, not Nudnik, as HelloWorld Author

In a panic about how the HelloWorld author i.d. differing from the GitHub i.d. can confuse reviewers of my project.  Explanation: my first github acc't had the i.d. "fabryperot." Because of problems with my HelloWorld file after pushing it to github, I, Ray A., created another github acc't with the i.d."nudnik" and successfully pushed the HelloWorld.md file.

Somehow fabryperot stayed associated with the file on GitHub.

fabryperot and nudnik are both the same user: Ray A.  All work in this course has been my own. I am on Signature Track meaning a webcam image and typing sample each time I submit work.  Also, my Coursera email address is the same as fabryperot's github email.

I hope this note helps, but I expect that my course project has been compromised.  C'est la vie ...
